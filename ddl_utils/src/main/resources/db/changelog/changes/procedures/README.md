# Stored procedures

Multi-`ALTER TABLE` operations are implemented as procedures, not functions,
because a function cannot `COMMIT` mid-call: after its first `ALTER TABLE` the
table is held under a lock until the caller's transaction ends. A procedure can
`COMMIT` between steps and release each lock before the next step runs, which is
what makes a long verification scan tolerable.

One procedure per `.sql` file under `procedures/<schema>/`, named `snake_case`
without an `NNN-` prefix. `changes/procedures.xml` holds one `NNN-`prefixed
`runOnChange` changeset per procedure (a `createProcedure` plus its rollback);
`changes/procedures-rollback/<schema>/` holds the rollback bodies.

## The orchestration rule

A procedure **orchestrates**; it does not implement DDL or locking.

- Every step calls a purpose-named single-call **function** — preferably the
  matching `ddl_utils_lib` helper (`add_check_constraint`,
  `validate_constraint`, `drop_constraint`, `add_foreign_key`, `set_not_null`,
  …). If a needed single-call operation has no helper, add the helper first
  rather than inlining a fragment.
- A procedure **never** calls `ddl_utils_lib.alter_table` directly, and never
  contains a `lock_timeout`, retry, sleep or spin loop. All of that lives in the
  function layer (`ddl_utils_lib.alter_table` and the helpers built on it), so a
  procedure reads as a sequence of named operations.
- The only things a procedure owns are the `COMMIT` boundaries and the
  idempotency checks that decide whether each step still needs to run.

## Pattern (verified against PostgreSQL 17)

The template every procedure follows:

```sql
DECLARE
    l_lock integer; l_sleep integer; l_dur integer;
BEGIN
    -- Read the settings once for the whole call.
    SELECT ddl_lock_timeout, sleep_time, statement_duration
      INTO l_lock, l_sleep, l_dur
      FROM ddl_utils.get_lock_settings(i_schema_name, i_table_name);

    -- Step: skip when the catalog shows the work is already done.
    IF <step not yet done> THEN
        PERFORM ddl_utils_lib.<helper>(..., l_lock, l_sleep, l_dur);
        COMMIT;                      -- release the lock before the next step
    END IF;

    -- ... further steps, each its own IF/PERFORM/COMMIT ...
END;
```

Findings that the pattern rests on:

- **Calling a function per step works.** A procedure can `PERFORM` a
  single-call function, `COMMIT`, then `PERFORM` the next; the function's
  `SET LOCAL lock_timeout` and its exception/retry loop run correctly inside
  that step's transaction, and `lock_timeout` is restored before the next
  `COMMIT`.
- **Settings are read once.** `ddl_utils.get_lock_settings` is `STABLE`; the
  values are captured at the top of the call and reused across steps. They need
  not be re-read after a `COMMIT`.
- **`55P03` propagates by itself.** When a step cannot take its lock within the
  budget, the function raises `55P03`; it travels out of the procedure unchanged
  and leaves the transaction in a state the client can simply retry. The
  procedure needs no `EXCEPTION` block for it.
- **Partial failure is recoverable from the catalog.** Each step's guard tests
  the catalog (for example `pg_constraint.conname` / `convalidated`,
  `pg_attribute.attnotnull`), so a call that starts after a previous call
  committed some but not all steps resumes at the first unfinished step and
  completes with no human intervention.
- **A genuine data failure is left recoverable.** If `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`
  fails with `23514`, the temporary constraint stays in place as `NOT VALID`;
  the caller fixes the data and re-runs, and the re-run validates, sets
  `NOT NULL`, and drops the temporary constraint.

## Caller contract

Because a procedure commits, it must run in **autocommit**. Calling it inside a
client-side transaction block fails with `invalid transaction termination`.
From JDBC/jOOQ that means autocommit on (the tests do this).

## Procedures

A procedure cannot share a name and argument types with a function, so the
multi-step procedures take an `ensure_` prefix while the single-call function of
the same name stays as-is (for example `ddl_utils.ensure_not_null` procedure vs
`ddl_utils.set_not_null` function). The `ensure_` name signals "make it so,
re-runnably".

### `ddl_utils.ensure_not_null(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_column_name)`

```sql
i_schema_name ddl_utils.non_null_text
i_table_name  ddl_utils.non_null_text
i_column_name ddl_utils.non_null_text
```

Make a column `NOT NULL` without holding `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` across the
verification scan. Steps, each committed before the next:

1. `ddl_utils_lib.add_check_constraint(<tmp>, '<col> IS NOT NULL')` — instant,
   `NOT VALID`, brief `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`. Skipped when the column is already
   `NOT NULL` or `<tmp>` already exists.
2. `ddl_utils_lib.validate_constraint(<tmp>)` — scans under `SHARE UPDATE
   EXCLUSIVE`. Skipped when the column is already `NOT NULL` or `<tmp>` is
   already valid.
3. `ddl_utils_lib.set_not_null(<col>)` — skips its scan because the valid
   `CHECK` proves the column non-null. Skipped when the column is already
   `NOT NULL`.
4. `ddl_utils_lib.drop_constraint(<tmp>)` — cleanup; always runs, so a leftover
   temporary constraint is removed.

`<tmp>` is deterministic from the table and column, so a re-run finds the same
constraint. A call interrupted after any step is completed by re-running it. A
call on an already-`NOT NULL` column performs no `ALTER TABLE` at all, so a
re-applied migration does not re-take an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock or re-scan the
table.

### `ddl_utils.ensure_check_constraint(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_constraint_name, i_check_expression)`

```sql
i_schema_name      ddl_utils.non_null_text
i_table_name       ddl_utils.non_null_text
i_constraint_name  ddl_utils.non_null_text
i_check_expression ddl_utils.non_null_text
```

Add a `CHECK` constraint and validate it in two committed steps, so the `ACCESS
EXCLUSIVE` lock of `ADD CONSTRAINT` is released before the scan:

1. `ddl_utils_lib.add_check_constraint(<name>, <expr>)` — `NOT VALID`, instant.
2. `ddl_utils_lib.validate_constraint(<name>)` — scans under `SHARE UPDATE
   EXCLUSIVE`.

A re-run skips the add when the constraint exists and the validate when it is
already valid. A violation by existing rows fails validation with `23514` and
leaves the constraint `NOT VALID`; fix the data and re-run.

The constraint **name is the identity**: a same-named `CHECK` is treated as the
target and its expression is not re-checked. A `CHECK` expression cannot be
compared exactly (`pg_get_constraintdef` returns a normalized, version-dependent
form), so use a distinct name per expression.

### `ddl_utils.ensure_foreign_key(i_schema_name, i_table_name, i_constraint_name, i_column_names, i_referenced_schema_name, i_referenced_table_name, i_referenced_column_names)`

```sql
i_schema_name             ddl_utils.non_null_text
i_table_name              ddl_utils.non_null_text
i_constraint_name         ddl_utils.non_null_text
i_column_names            ddl_utils.non_empty_non_null_text_array
i_referenced_schema_name  ddl_utils.non_null_text
i_referenced_table_name   ddl_utils.non_null_text
i_referenced_column_names ddl_utils.non_empty_non_null_text_array
```

Same two committed steps as `ensure_check_constraint`, for a foreign key:
`ddl_utils_lib.add_foreign_key` (NOT VALID, `SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE` on both
tables) then `ddl_utils_lib.validate_constraint`. Idempotent and recoverable the
same way.

Unlike a `CHECK`, a foreign key can be compared exactly, so a same-named key
that references different columns or a different table is not silently accepted:
the procedure compares `confrelid` and the ordered `conkey`/`confkey` and raises
`42710` when the definition differs.
